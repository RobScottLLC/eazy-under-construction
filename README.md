# Eazy Under Construction

##Frequently Asked Questions 
**I'm finished with it, and disabled the plugin, but the "under construction" message is still showing up!**  
If you've disabled the plugin, it won't show anything anymore. To be extra super-sure, try deleting the plugin files. Usually, though, the issue is that you're seeing a cached version of the page. Try force-refreshing your browser, and then try clearing your cache on the server and force refreshing again. If you have a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache, make sure you clear that too!  
  
**I can't see the under construction page!**  
As long as you're logged in, you won't be able to see it. That's a feature! This way, while you're logged in you can work as usual. To preview what it looks like, either a) log out, or b) try viewing it in another browser.  
  
**What kind of HTML can I put in?**  
You enter the contents of the entire HTML file. You can include inline styles, or links to external style sheets and external images.
