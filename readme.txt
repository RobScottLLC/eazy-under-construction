Creates a 'Coming Soon' page that will show for all users who are not logged in

== Description ==

Creates a 'Coming Soon' page that will show for all users who are not logged in. Useful for developing a site on a live server, without the world being able to see it. This is an ad-free fork of the great Under Construction plugin by Jeremy Massel.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. If you want to change the look of the page that is displayed, click Settings->Under Construction and change the settings there.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm finished with it, and disabled the plugin, but the "under construction" message is still showing up! =
If you've disabled the plugin, it won't show anything anymore. To be extra super-sure, try deleting the plugin files. Usually, though, the issue is that you're seeing a cached version of the page. Try force-refreshing your browser, and then try clearing your cache on the server and force refreshing again. If you have a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache, make sure you clear that too!

= I can't see the under construction page! =
As long as you're logged in, you won't be able to see it. That's a feature! This way, while you're logged in you can work as usual. To preview what it looks like, either a) log out, or b) try viewing it in another browser

= What kind of HTML can I put in? =
You enter the contents of the entire HTML file. You can include inline styles, or links to external style sheets and external images.
