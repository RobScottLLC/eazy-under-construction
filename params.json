If you want to change the look of the page that is displayed, click Settings->Under Construction and change the settings there.\r\n\r\n##Frequently Asked Questions \r\n**I'm finished with it, and disabled the plugin, but the \"under construction\" message is still showing up!**  \r\nIf you've disabled the plugin, it won't show anything anymore. To be extra super-sure, try deleting the plugin files. Usually, though, the issue is that you're seeing a cached version of the page. Try force-refreshing your browser, and then try clearing your cache on the server and force refreshing again. If you have a caching plugin like W3 Total Cache, make sure you clear that too!  \r\n  \r\n**I can't see the under construction page!**  \r\nAs long as you're logged in, you won't be able to see it. That's a feature! This way, while you're logged in you can work as usual. To preview what it looks like, either a) log out, or b) try viewing it in another browser.  \r\n  \r\n**What kind of HTML can I put in?**  \r\nYou enter the contents of the entire HTML file. You can include inline styles, or links to external style sheets and external images.  \r\n\r\n##WordPress Requirements\r\nRequires at least: 2.7  \r\nTested up to: 4.2.4  \r\n\r\n##Changelog\r\n= 1.0 =  \r\nFirst version\r\n\r\n\r\n##Screenshots \r\n![The default page that is displayed.
